# Global Pollution Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes global pollution-related datasets to uncover trends over time, compare regions, and explore relationships with population and climate indicators. It combines **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **interactive visualizations**, and **time‑series forecasting** to provide data‑driven insights.

## Objectives

* Analyze long‑term global pollution trends
* Visualize changes across years and regions
* Explore relationships between pollution metrics and population data
* Apply deep learning models for time‑series forecasting

## Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
* **Machine Learning / Deep Learning:** Scikit‑learn, Keras (LSTM, GRU)
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Key Features

* Data preprocessing and cleaning of multiple CSV datasets
* Statistical and visual exploration of pollution indicators
* Interactive charts using Plotly
* Time‑series forecasting using LSTM/GRU neural networks
* Trend comparison across years

## Project Structure

* `Global-Polution-Analysis.ipynb` — Main notebook containing analysis, visualizations, and models
* CSV datasets — External data files used for pollution and population analysis

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn tensorflow keras
   ```
3. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
